        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                This paper will explain how multiplayer can be implemented using Untiy as game engine and Photonâ€™s networking functionality.
                The main purposes of this paper is to offer info about implementing a dedicated server, connecting clients to it, spawning and synchronizing virtual players on the network.

            <h2>Unity and Photon Server</h2>
            <p>
                    Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Photon is a on-premises real-time socket server and cross platform multiplayer game development framework that is extremely fast and very simple to use.
            </p>

            <section id="protocols">
                <h3>Protocols of Photon Server</h3>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>reliable UDP</strong> (based on eNET) and specially tuned for Client-2-Server architectures</li>
                    <li>Binary Tcp</li>
                    <li>Web Sockets</li>
                    <li>Http</li>
                </p>

                <p>The transfer protocol is very lean and slim. Photon wraps up the networking layer of each client platform for you. Have your game clients communicate cross-platform and across protocols. Put your data in hashtables and just send it. Photon does the de-/serialization, you dont!</p>
