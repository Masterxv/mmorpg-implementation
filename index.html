        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                This paper will explain how multiplayer can be implemented using Untiy as game engine and Photonâ€™s networking functionality.
                The main purposes of this is to offer info about implementing a dedicated server, connecting clients to it, spawning and synchronizing virtual players on the network.

            <h2>Unity and Photon Server</h2>
            <p>
                    Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Photon is a on-premises real-time socket server and cross platform multiplayer game development framework that is extremely fast and very simple to use.

    <section id="protocols">
        <h3>Protocols of Photon Server</h3>
        <p>
            <li><strong>reliable UDP</strong> (based on eNET) and specially tuned for Client-2-Server architectures</li>
            <li>Binary Tcp</li>
            <li>Web Sockets</li>
            <li>Http</li>
        </p>

        <p>The transfer protocol is very lean and slim. Photon wraps up the networking layer of each client platform for you. Have your game clients communicate cross-platform and across protocols. Put your data in hashtables and just send it. Photon does the de-/serialization, you dont!</p>

        <h3>Download server sdk and prepare structure </h3>
        <p>
        Photon is extremely easy to install and start. The SDK includes ready-to-use binaries which can be up and running within 5 minutes.
        The Photon Server SDKs are available on the official page and comes as self-extracting executable.
       </p>
        <p> The server package ca be extracted to any place - preferably an empty folder prepared beforehand. 
            The extraction creates several folders. The "deploy" folder contains the binaries. This is what you need at least to run Photon. The folders doc, lib and src-server (applications) are for development.
        </p>
       <h3>Starting Photon</h3>
       <p>In the "deploy" folder you will find a folder per application and some folders starting with "bin".
            Open one of these two:  
    <li><strong>bin_Win32</strong>: Windows Vista and up</li>
    <li><strong>bin_Win64</strong>: 64 bit Windows Vista and up</li>
    </p>
        <p>In either folder, you will find the actual Photon executable. You can start this with command-line arguments or you can use PhotonControl.
        Start PhotonControl.exe and confirm the admin rights for this application. They are needed for the option to setup Photon as a Service.  
    </p>

    <h3>Build server application</h3>
    <p>
        Using Visual Studio, create a new class library project MyServer. After this
        is important to add references to <strong>ExitGamesLibs.dll, Photon.SocketServer.dll, PhotonHostRuntimeInterfaces.dll</strong>
and loggings dll's <strong>log4net.dll, ExitGame.Logging.Log4Net.dll </strong>.
    </p> 
    <p>
    Next step is to create an class that inherits from Photon.SocketServer.ApplicationBase. This class is the core luncher of the server and contains a reference to log4net object that will be used in logging.
    Every client request is handled by an special class inhterited from ClientPeer.
</p>

    
    <h4>Operation concept</h4>

    <p>The server project deal with game logic of every client, chat operations and game world.
        The game logic defines how a client can interact with the server. It implements operations, events, and anything that the server does by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
            An operation is Photon's equivalent to a remote procedure call. Photon clients use operation calls for anything they want to get done.
            Operations and all of their parameters are defined in the <strong>PhotonMMORPG.Common</strong> project. Clients can call any operation by setting up a hashtable with keys and values fitting the operation's conventions. The client and server frameworks take care of serialization, transfer and deserialization.
    </p>

    <h4>Event concept</h4>

    <p>
            Photon Events are messages for clients. Each event is typed by a byte code and carries game updates.
            Unlike operation results, a received event is most likely caused another client's operation call. This means: Events might arrive anytime. Lite sends events when someone joins or leaves a room.
    </p>
